# Deciduous
A web app that simplifies building attack decision trees as described in the Security Chaos Engineering report. Hosted at https://www.deciduous.app/

How to / getting started guide: https://kellyshortridge.com/blog/posts/deciduous-attack-tree-app/

Theme options include:
- `theme: default` - the default tree styling
- `theme: accessible` - for more color differentiation between attack and mitigation nodes
- `theme: classic` - classic Graphviz styling
