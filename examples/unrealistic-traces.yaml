title: Adverse Scenario - Unrealistic Distributed Traces

facts:
- no_trace_ids: no trace IDs
  from:
  - reality: '#yolo'

attacks:
- incon_trace_ids: inconsistent trace IDs
  from:
  - trace_ids
- encoding_issues: encoding issues in the trace ID
  from:
  - read_headers
- illogical_spans: illogical spans
  from:
  - trace_ids
- timestamp_mismatch: timestamp mismatches
  from:
  - illogical_spans
- general_trace: trace isn't granular enough
  from:
  - sync_time

mitigations:
- trace_ids: add trace IDs
  from:
  - reality
  - no_trace_ids
- read_headers: properly read tracing headers
  from:
  - incon_trace_ids
- decode_headers: decode tracing headers properly
  from:
  - encoding_issues
- sync_time: synchronize time on hosts
  from: 
  - timestamp_mismatch
- annotate_spans: annotate additional spans
  from:
  - general_trace

goals:
- unrealistic_traces: Unrealistic distributed traces (traces don't reflect reality)
  from:
  - no_trace_ids
  - incon_trace_ids
  - encoding_issues
  - timestamp_mismatch
  - general_trace
